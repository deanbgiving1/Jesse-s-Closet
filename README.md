Jesse’s Closet is a simple web project built using Python’s Flask as well as some basic HTML. The goal of this website was for it to be a curated collection for clothing items inspired by Jesse Pinkman, a very popular iconic character from the TV show Breaking Bad.

Jesse’s fashion sense is characterized by oversized hoodies, bold graphic tees, and baggy jeans, a style that has been a staple in pop-culture since the shows release over 15 years ago. Whether you're looking for exact replicas of outfits he wore in the show or similar pieces that fit the aesthetic, this site is designed to be a resource for fans of his look.

This project came from my passion for Jesse's style and was a fun exercise in web development. It showcases how Flask can be used to build a straightforward yet functional site that doesn't require a public domain to be accessed.
